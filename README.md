## Introduction
Python is the most popular language for machine learning and data science. This repository has a collection of utilities for poqet ai. You may find them useful outside of poqet ai. 

## Supported Frameworks
Tensorflow - supported

pyTorch - planned for future release

## Requirements

* Python 3.10
* Tensorflow 2.10
* Tensorflow Datasets
* Numpy
* marshmallow

## Keras Core

Keras is currently transitioning to Keras Core. There's two significant changes with Keras Core:

* support for different backends
* new model format

Support for Keras Core is in progress. We recommend waiting until Keras Core matures and the switch is announced. There's a conda configuration for keras core, but expect to debug issues. Only use it if you want to play with the latest version and don't mind installing from github.
